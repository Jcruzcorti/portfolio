# Welcome to my Portfolio!

The project consists of developing my portfolio, with professional and personal information, showing my knowledge, my academic background and my built projects, as well as my personal qualities


## Project details:
The project is worked with technologies such as JavaScript, Next.js and using Email.js API. 

It consists of 5 sections, the first one is a presentation banner in which besides my personal photo, and a button to change the background color, there are 4 circles with redirection to the other 4 sections. The first one, CV, shows my academic qualifications, skills, knowledge and languages. The second one, my built projects. Regarding the third one, the idea is to talk a little about myself by commenting a presentation and my personal interests. Also, the last section shows a contact form for any person/company to send me a message by mail with their respective data. Finally, in the footer are my networks in case you want to contact me through them.



## Steps to view the site


In our default terminal, we clone the folder by typing "git clone" + link:

1- git clone https://github.com/Jcruzcorti/portfolio

2- Then, we place ourselves in the root folder of the project, with the command "cd PORTFOLIO" and install all the dependencies inside with the command "npm install".

3-Finally, in the terminal we carry out the command "npm run dev" or "yarn dev" and the web will open in the predetermined browser after a few seconds/minutes of waiting.
